Purpose:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process.
It involves analyzing and visualizing data to summarize its main characteristics, discover patterns, spot anomalies,
and test hypotheses before applying more complex statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms. 
EDA helps to understand the data's structure, distribution, and relationships, which is crucial for making informed decisions and building effective models.

Steps in EDA:
   Data Collection and Preparation:
           Load Data: Import data from various sources like CSV files, databases, or APIs.
           Clean Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
           Transform Data: Convert data types, create new features, or normalize data as needed.
   Basic Data Exploration:
           Head and Tail: View the first and last few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
           Info and Summary Statistics: Get an overview of data types, non-null counts, and basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
   Univariate Analysis:
           Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the distribution of individual features (e.g., mean, median, quartiles).
           Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numerical features to understand their range and frequency.
   Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:
           Scatter Plots: Examine relationships between pairs of numerical features to identify correlations or patterns.
           Pair Plots: Explore relationships between multiple pairs of features simultaneously.
           Box Plots: Visualize the distribution of features and identify outliers.
   Correlation Analysis:
            Correlation Matrix: Calculate and visualize correlations between numerical features to understand their interdependencies.
            Heatmaps: Provide a visual representation of the correlation matrix, making it easier to spot strong or weak correlations.
  Insights and Visualization:
           Patterns and Trends: Identify trends, clusters, or anomalies in the data through various visualizations.
           Comparisons: Compare distributions and relationships across different categories or groups within the data.
